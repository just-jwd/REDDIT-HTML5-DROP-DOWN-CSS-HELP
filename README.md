REDDIT HTML5 DROP DOWN CSS HELP 

Hello Beginner here, I am trying to get the drop down to drop down. I am having trouble with the CSS of it all. Can some one please tell me where I am going wrong with my CSS file.

Is the structure of my drop downs within my HTML  ok? I can t seem to figure out the .main-menu ul li parts to get the submenus working. I've hit a mental wall.

Also I kind of new to GIT so I hope I did this correctly.

Thank you !

Humble Beginner
